This is a plugin for YOURLS that will make it case insensitive.

For example, if you create a short link like http://sho.rt/MyLink then any variation of it (mylink, MYLINK, MyLiNk, etc.) will also work and redirect to the same URL.

Also, if MyLink already exists then the system will not allow you to create new short links using any variation of MyLink as the keyword.
